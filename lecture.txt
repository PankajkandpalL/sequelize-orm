Connecting server with SQL-Database

MySql

 - Sequelize
    - ORM Library

- Select * from users;
- select count(*) from users;
- Forign key, Primary Key, 


- Create table

 - provides us the methods to perform same operations.
    users.create(), users.findAll()

- FE - Deployed
- BE - not Deployed
    - static css, static components will get rendered.
    - sort some data - feature here your fe is dependent on your backend.
        - crash the page
        - it goes into the buffering stage

BE - Deployed
DB - not Deployed/Hosted
    - BE will be able to able to serve the requests
    - Sometimes BE will crash,  
    request -----> Servers
                -----> processing that request
                    ---> (middleware) validation is done ----> controller (business logic/CRUD operations)
                        ----> (fetchUsers) ---> fetching users data from the (local) database
                            ----> this would crash the server and result in error

- Deploy the app
    - Cloud Database (hosted databases)

- How can we host our database?
